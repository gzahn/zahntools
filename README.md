# zahntools

This is just a collection of tools that should probably all be in one place.

Many of these functions are extensions of packages I commonly use, and thus have lots of dependencies. If you find yourself wanting to use any of these functions, you probably already have those packages installed.


#### Installation

```
devtools::install_github("gzahn/zahntools")
```
